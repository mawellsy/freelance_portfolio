A collection of practical tools, scripts, and checklists designed for beginner-friendly freelance tech work. These projects target real problems clients often face: messy data, unorganized files, unsafe devices, and basic automation needs.

Everything here is simple, clean, and built to be easy for non-technical users to run.

This portfolio is part of my early-stage freelance journey.
The goal: build simple but useful tools that solve real problems for clients and demonstrate real capability in Python automation, security basics, and data cleaning.

# 🏁 Done.

Your repo will now look like a fully professional, polished, modern portfolio—even if you're still figuring out how to air-fry chicken without committing a crime.

If you want, I can now also:

* Add **project banners** (small PNGs)
* Create a **GitHub Pages portfolio site**
* Write a **clean Upwork overview** that uses this repo as proof
* Make a **skills badge section**

Just name it.
