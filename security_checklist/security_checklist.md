What is this checklist for?
    This is a checklist build to design and follow secure and safe digital practices to protect against the most common threats and or exploits to guarantee privacy online and the saftey of your data.

1. Passwords
    - Use a password manager to safely store and access all passwords.
    - Create passwords with at least 12–16 characters to increase protection.
    - Never reuse passwords so old breaches cannot affect new accounts.
    - Avoid common patterns such as birthdays or names to prevent easy guessing.

2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    - Enable 2FA on email accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
    - Enable 2FA on financial accounts because they contain the most sensitive data.
    - Prefer authenticator apps over SMS because they are harder to intercept.

3. Devices
    - Keep your operating system updated; updates fix known security vulnerabilities.
    - Turn on auto-update for apps so they stay secure with the latest patches.
    - Use a screen lock to prevent physical access to your information.
    - Avoid installing unknown apps; they may contain malware or unsafe permissions.

4. Backups
    - Use cloud backup services (Google Drive/OneDrive/iCloud) to prevent permanent data loss.
    - Back up important files weekly or monthly to keep the latest versions safe.
    - Keep one offline backup if possible for extra protection and redundancy.

5. Wi-Fi & Network
    - Change the router’s default password, since defaults are easy for attackers to guess.
    - Use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption for stronger wireless security.
    - Avoid sharing Wi-Fi with strangers to reduce risk of misuse or attacks.
    - Disable WPS if possible as it has known vulnerabilities and can be brute-forced.

6. Email Hygiene
    - Avoid clicking suspicious links; always verify the sender first.
    - Check the sender’s full address to confirm legitimacy.
    - Ignore urgent or threatening emails, as attackers use fear to trick users.
    - Enable and use spam filters to automatically block unwanted messages.

7. Browsing Hygiene
    - Disable unnecessary extensions because they may access sensitive information.
    - Use HTTPS-only mode for safer, encrypted connections.
    - Log out from accounts on public or shared computers to prevent misuse.

8. Basic Device Security for Students
    - Avoid storing school/ID documents unencrypted to protect sensitive data.
    - Keep academic and personal files in separate folders for better organization and privacy.
    - Turn off Bluetooth in public when not needed; it reduces exposure to attacks.
